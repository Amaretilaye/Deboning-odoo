#Deponing Accuracy for Chicken and Meat Stock Valuation

This Odoo module is designed to ensure accurate stock valuation for chicken and meat deboning processes across multiple warehouses. The module automates the calculation of deboned meat quantities and tracks the movement of stock between specific locations, ensuring precise management of in-stock and out-stock items.

## Features

- **Accurate Stock Valuation**: Automatically calculates the deboning amount for chicken and meat, ensuring accurate tracking of stock values.
- **Custom Stock Movement**: Moves deboned stock from one specified location to another, adjusting inventory levels in real-time.
- **Multiple Warehouse Support**: The module supports multiple warehouses, following standard warehouse management practices for deboning.
- **Stock Adjustments**: Reduces stock from the source warehouse and adds it to the destination warehouse after deboning.
- **Easy Management**: Simplifies the stock transfer process for meat and chicken deboning operations, reducing manual intervention.

## How It Works

1. **Deboning Calculation**: The module accurately calculates the amount of deboned chicken or meat based on the raw material input.
